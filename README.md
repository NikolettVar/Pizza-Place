# Pizza-Place
Higher Diploma in Computing, Software Development, Web Design and Client Side Scripting module. 
This small project was created as part of a Continuous Assessment. 

A new pizza company in town needs an online ordering page. 
When ordering online, the customer should provide:
Username and password (password must be 7 characters in length), the size of the pizza they would like: Large, Extra-Large, Supersize, the number of pizzas they want 
and a discount code.
The pizza’s cost: Large - €5, Extra-Large - €7, Supersize - €100.
This month’s discount code is ‘extracheese’ which gives 10% discount from the total.
The project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of jQuery.
